### Introduction 
This implementation specification is based on the [FHIR version R4](https://hl7.org/fhir/R4/), and defines a unified framework for representing the Emergency Medical Service (EMS) Record of Intervention (ZOV ZZS) in the Czech national context. The specification defines the content and structural components of the document and ensures their compliance with the legal requirements of the Czech Republic as well as with European initiatives in the field of electronic health record interoperability. 

The main objective is to create a standardized form of the EMS Record of Intervention as part of the patientâ€™s medical documentation, which will be used for the electronic exchange of health information between healthcare providers, the patient, and the national infrastructure. The specification covers both national scenarios and potential future cross-border exchange within the European Health Data Space (EHDS). 

This document focuses exclusively on defining the content, structure, and data model of the EMS Record of Intervention. The technical aspects of document transmission and the procedural workflows of EMS crews are not within its scope and are addressed in related standards and methodological guidelines.
