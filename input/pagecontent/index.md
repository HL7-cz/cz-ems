### Introduction 
This implementation guide is based on [FHIR version R4](https://hl7.org/fhir/R4/). Specify a set of rules that will be used for HL7 FHIR to define how to represent Emergency medical service report in the Czech national context, in line with European eHN guidelines.

The purpose of this standard is to define the representation of the Emergency medical service report as a patient's medical record for the purpose of electronic exchange of health information between individuals, healthcare providers and infrastructure in the Czech Republic. 

This guide does not describe how to exchange this message.
